Hari,


Here뭩 a link to an idea for the dashboard: https://moqups.com/grantctaylor/a1VuEKxL
 

It뭩 based on the attached dashboard, which shows an integration between Pardot and GoodData. 

The dashboard shows selected metrics that demonstrate results or indicate potential results.

 

The metrics are:

         New contacts

         Engaged contacts

         Touched contacts

         Tours

         New opportunities

 

When the User selects a metric, then we뭠l reveal a list of data.

 

Also included in the dashboard is a 2-week calendar view of scheduled campaigns, activities, and meetings.

 

Please have the team review and provide feedback.

 

Also, please have the team provide feedback on the report wireframes.
